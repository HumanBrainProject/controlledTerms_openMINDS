  "name": "APP/PS1 mouse model",
  "definition": "The APP/PS1 mouse model is a trangenic mouse line typically used to study Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaque formation and aging.",
  "description": "The transgenic mouse line has mutations for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1)(e.g. a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), respectively). They are used as disease model for Alzheimer's disease, but also generally for amyloid plaque formation and aging.",
